# C.M.P-MINI-PROJECT
OBJECT DETECTION PROJECT :

We implementing real-time object detection Faster then traditional way . The main motive of object detection is to recognize and locate all known object in a scene . Probably  in 3D space in real time . Like car , Flower , bike , phone  etc .

PROBLEM  STATEMENT :

Blind people do lead a normal life with their own style of doing things. But, they definitely face troubles due to inaccessible infrastructure and social challenges. The biggest challenge for a blind person, especially the one with the complete loss of vision, is to navigate around places. Obviously, blind people roam easily around their house without any help because they know the position of everything in the house. Blind people have a tough time finding objects around them. . So we decided to make a C.M.P OBJECT DETECTION System. We are interested in this project after we went through few papers in this area. As a result we are highly motivated to develop a system that recognizes objects in the real time environment
